/**
 * The point cloud renderer uses WebGPU compute shaders to render the point cells of a polydata onto
 * the framebuffer of a given WebGPURenderer.
 *
 * The implementation is based on the paper from ShÃ¼tz et. al:
 * https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2021/SCHUETZ-2021-PCC/
 *
 * Only the basic version presented in the paper has been implemented (described as 'atomicMin' in
 * the paper), WebGPU not having the required features (warp-level intrinsics most notably) at the
 * time of implementing (august 2024). Writing to a depth buffer from a compute shader (depth buffer
 * texture storage) is also a very ill-supported feature (~1% of devices). One option could be to
 * copy the point depth buffer to the depth buffer of the render window with a CopyBufferToTexture
 * operation but copying to the depth aspect of a depth buffer isn't supported by Dawn yet.
 * Our solution is thus to employ a fragment shader pass with the point depth buffer bound to it.
 * The shader can then write to the depth buffer.
 *
 * The renderer support point colors through point scalars.
 *
 * This implementation will run into issues if WebGPU uses the OpenGL backend. This is because
 * OpenGL has its texture coordinate origin (0, 0) at the bottom left corner of the texture whereas
 * the shader of the point cloud mapper expects the (0, 0) of the texture to be in the top left
 * corner. With OpenGL, this will cause reads into the depth buffer to be reversed along the Y axis
 * and incorrect depth values will be read --> invalid depth handling --> issues will arise with
 * multiple point clouds per renderer or a point cloud mixed with regular triangle based geometry.
