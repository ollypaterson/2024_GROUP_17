/**
 * This culler does both frustum culling and occlusion culling.
 *
 * Occlusion culling culls props that are occluded (behind) other props and that are not visible to
 * the camera because of that.
 *
 * This implementation uses the two-pass hierarchical z-buffer approach.
 *
 * This approach projects the bound of the actors onto the viewport and compares the depth of the
 * projected region with a prepass depth buffer. This "prepass" depth buffer is built from the
 * objects that were rendered last frame. These objects offer a good approximation of what objects
 * will be visible this frame (assuming no brutal camera movements). To make the depth comparison
 * between the quad of the actor (projection of its bounding box on the viewport) more efficient, a
 * mipmap chain of the depth buffer is used. Without this mipmap chain, we would have to compare the
 * depth of all the pixels (there could be dozens to hundreds of thousands depending on the
 * screen-space size of the actor) of the projected bouding box of the actor against the depth
 * buffer which would be way too expensive. Using a mipmap chain allows us to choose the right
 * mipmap so that we only have to check a few (~4 +/- 2) pixels for the depth.
 *
 * Resource for a general overview of the algorithm:
 * https://medium.com/@mil_kru/two-pass-occlusion-culling-4100edcad501
 *
 * Resource for non-power of two mipmap calculation:
 * https://miketuritzin.com/post/hierarchical-depth-buffers/
 *
 * To use this culler, simply instantiate it and set its RenderWindow (after Initialize() has been
 * called on the RenderWindow()):
 *
 * vtkNew<vtkWebGPUComputeOcclusionCuller> webgpuOcclusionCuller;
 *
 * renWin->Initialize();
 * webgpuOcclusionCuller->SetRenderWindow(renWin)
 *
 * Then add it to the cullers of your renderer:
 *
 * renderer->GetCullers()->AddItem(webgpuOcclusionCuller);
 *
 * You may also want to remove the default CPU coverage culler of your renderer by calling :
 *
 * renderer->GetCullers()->RemoveAllItems();
 *
 * before adding the webgpuOcclusionCuller.
 *
 * @warning: In its current state, the compute occlusion culler is expected to fail if the WebGPU
 * backend used is OpenGL. This is because OpenGL has its texture coordinate origin (0, 0) at the
 * bottom left corner of the texture whereas the shader of the occlusion culler expects the (0, 0)
 * of the texture to be in the top left corner. With OpenGL, this will cause reads into the depth
 * buffer to be reversed along the Y axis and incorrect depth values will be read --> invalid
 * culling.
