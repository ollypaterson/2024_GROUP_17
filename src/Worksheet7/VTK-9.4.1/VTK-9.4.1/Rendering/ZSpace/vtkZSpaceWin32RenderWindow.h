 * @class vtkZSpaceWin32RenderWindow
 * @brief OpenGL render window for stereo rendering on ZSpace Inspire
 *
 * `vtkZSpaceWin32RenderWindow` is a subclass of `vtkWin32OpenGLRenderWindow` designed to
 * handle stereo rendering on zSpace Inspire. This class should not be used with pre-Inspire
 * hardware relying on quad-buffering. In such cases, use a `vtkRenderWindow` instead.
 *
 * `StereoRender` should be enabled on this window in order to make it to work as expected.
 *
 * This class interacts with the zSpace Core Compatibility API under the hood, that takes care
 * of left and right images composition and final rendering into the mono backbuffer.
 * In more details, this class overrides several methods of `vtkRenderWindow` in order to:
 * - Use the `RenderFrameBuffer` and `DisplayFrameBuffer` to store the left and right
 * eye textures respectively
 * - Let the zSpace API to do the composition of the stereo image (instead of the
 * internal `StereoCompositor`)
 * - Avoid blitting to the backbuffer (the zSpace API takes care of it)
 *
 * This class have similar behavior than `vtkZSpaceGenericRenderWindow`, but is intended
 * to be used with it's own OpenGL context, like `vtkWin32OpenGLRenderWindow`.
 *
 * Please note that this window should be shown fullscreen in order to have a working
 * stereo effect. ZSpace Inspire stereo is done directly by the screen (stereo display)
 * and the pixels of the front buffer should perfectly fit the pixel grid of the screen
 * (i.e. resolution of the front buffer and the display should be equal).
